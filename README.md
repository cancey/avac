# avac 4
This is the new version of AVAC, an avalanche-dynamics model.

AVAC 4 needs Clawpack version 5.11. See the related https://www.clawpack.org/installing.html. It may work with older Clawpack versions, but some functions may fail. It also needs a number of standard python scripts (numpy, matplotlib, IPython, etc.) whose installation is not a problem and a jupyter environnement (provided by an Integrated development environment such as Anaconda or Visual Studio Code).

See the jupyter notebook for installation.
